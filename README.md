## The Basics
- This is a pathfinding visualizer specifically for Dijkstra's and A* algorithm.
- The A* labeled toggle button swaps between the algorithm used for pathfinding between A* and Dijkstra.
- The Display Cost swaps between the displaying the cost in each node or none at all.
- The Grid Size accepts numerical input to change the size of the grid in both rows and columns.
- The Wall Chance accepts numerical input to change the chance of naturally generated walls.
- The Start and End Coords accepts numerical input to change the generated location for the Start and End.
- The Run button runs the pathfinding using the chosen algorithm.
- The Load accepts numerical input to load the saved templates baseed on the inputted index.
- The Save button saves the current grid state as a new index.
